# Changelog

All notable changes to cairnlock are documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog 1.1.0, and the project follows
Semantic Versioning 2.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Noise controls for adoption on large repositories:
  - `cairnlock.toml` (or `[tool.cairnlock]` in `pyproject.toml`) with
    `ignore` globs, `disabled_rules`, and a `fail_on` threshold.
  - `.cairnlockignore` with gitignore-style globs.
  - `scan --fail-on {low,medium,high,never}`: exit 1 only when a finding at
    or above the threshold exists. Exposed as the `fail-on` action input.
  - `scan --baseline <file>` and `--write-baseline`: known finding
    fingerprints are suppressed from reports and the exit decision.
  - The ASCII banner goes to stderr; JSON, SARIF, HTML, and Markdown output
    on stdout stay parseable. Regression tests cover this with the banner on.
- Discovery for more agent ecosystems, each with a fixture and a test:
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.windsurfrules`,
  `.clinerules` (file or directory), `.roo/**`, `.continue/**`,
  `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`,
  `claude_desktop_config.json`. Hidden agent directories (`.claude`,
  `.opencode`, `.cursor`, `.roo`, `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.vscode`,
  `.github`) are scanned; `.git`, `.venv`, and `node_modules` stay ignored.
  Fixes a discovery bug where files directly inside a hidden agent
  directory were never matched.
- PyPI packaging: complete project metadata, a release workflow
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that builds, runs `twine check`, and
  publishes with PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC), and a version-consistency
  test between `pyproject.toml` and `cairnlock.__version__`.
- `docs/rules-audit.md`: rule-by-rule audit of scope, overlaps, and
  agent-specific versus generic classification, pending review.
- Redesigned ASCII banner: stacked CAIRN/LOCK block wordmark.

### Changed

- Install docs lead with `pipx install cairnlock` and `uvx cairnlock scan`;
  the git+https install stays as a fallback.
- Action description shortened below the 125-character marketplace limit.

[0.4.0]: https://github.com/pennacle-security/cairnlock/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0

### Added

- `cairnlock verify --base <git-ref>`: reads `cairnlock.lock` as it exists at
  the given ref with `git show` and compares the working tree against it. A
  pull request that edits a tracked file and rehashes the lockfile in the
  same change now fails with "lockfile modified in this change".
- `--allow-lock-change` flag to permit lockfile-only changes.
- Exit code 2 for usage and environment errors in verify: refs starting with
  `-` are rejected before git runs, missing base lockfiles suggest running
  `cairnlock init` on the base branch, and shallow clones get a
  `fetch-depth: 0` hint for GitHub Actions.
- All git calls use an argument list, never a shell.
- `base-ref` and `allow-lock-change` inputs in `action.yml`, with a verify
  step that skips cleanly when no lockfile exists yet.
- Marketplace metadata in `action.yml` (name, description, branding).
- Documentation site in `docs/`: landing page, guide (lockfile workflow,
  base verification, CODEOWNERS, CI), and a full rule reference. Plain HTML,
  no build step.
- `docs/rules.md` as the SARIF helpUri target for every rule id.
- `SECURITY.md` with reporting instructions and scope.
- Dependabot config for pip and GitHub Actions.
- README section recommending CODEOWNERS protection for `cairnlock.lock`.

### Changed

- verify without a lockfile now exits 2 (usage/environment error) instead of 1.
- CLI status markers are plain text (`OK:`, `error:`, `warning:`) instead of
  emoji, per the project style rules.
- SARIF driver version now comes from the package version instead of a
  hard-coded string.
- Ruff ignores E501; long regex pattern tables and embedded report templates
  stay readable without manual line splitting.

### Fixed

- CI lint failures: `ruff check` passed locally on every configuration
  tested before this release.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/pennacle-security/cairnlock/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0
[0.2.0]: https://github.com/pennacle-security/cairnlock/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-24

### Added
- `cairnlock scan` with 18 static detection rules:
  - HUC001: invisible and bidirectional Unicode control characters in instruction files
  - PIN001: prompt-injection phrases in tool and skill descriptions
  - REM001: pipe-to-shell downloads, base64 payloads, and remote fetches in skill files
  - MCP001: auto-approve or permission-skipping flags in MCP server configs
  - MCP002: MCP filesystem servers mounted at a filesystem root
  - MCP003: MCP server with unpinned dangerous command
  - MCP004: MCP server passed sensitive environment variable
  - UNP001: npx and uvx packages without a version pin
  - SEC001: embedded credentials in agent context files
  - SHC001: shell command execution patterns (eval, exec, subprocess, os.system)
  - NET001: suspicious network or data exfiltration patterns
  - FSY001: suspicious file system access (path traversal, sensitive files, archives)
  - ENV001: environment variable manipulation and credential access
  - PRI001: privilege escalation and process injection patterns
  - OBF001: encoding, obfuscation, and data hiding patterns
  - SUP001: supply chain attack risks in dependencies
  - CFG001: configuration and template injection vulnerabilities
  - TOO001: tool and function calling injection risks
  - CRY001: cryptographic weaknesses and insecure randomness
- Lockfile commands: `init`, `verify`, `diff`, `approve`
- Output formats: text, JSON, SARIF 2.1.0, HTML, Markdown
- New CLI commands: `rules` (list all rules), `stats` (repository statistics)
- Enhanced CLI UX: ASCII banner, colored output, progress bars, verbose mode
- Composite GitHub Action (`action.yml`) for CI and Code Scanning upload
- Example pre-commit hook in `hooks/`
- CI workflow running ruff and pytest on Python 3.11 and 3.13

### Changed
- Enhanced SARIF output with rule help URIs and partial fingerprints
- Improved embedded secret detection with Shannon entropy validation
- Expanded MCP config analysis with 4 rule IDs
- Refined supply chain detection for dependency confusion risks

### Fixed
- Secret detection false positives on placeholder values
- Cross-rule false positives in good fixtures
